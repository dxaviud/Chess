# chess

## About
This is my implementation of Chess using Java. I used Java's Swing API to create the GUI.

## Execute
Make sure that [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) is installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file Main.java and run `javac Main.java` to compile the java files into bytecode (.class files), then `java Main` to execute the program.
